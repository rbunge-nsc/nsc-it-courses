Demonstration Web Site

This page illustrates networking technologies needed to host a web site like this one.

<p>
To reach a website, you need it's Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The URL for this site is: 

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:20px;">
https://mltv.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
</p>
<img src = "./images/aws-s3.PNG" width="800" >

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
URLs are composed of different elements. For this URL, the elements are:

<ul>
<li>Scheme: "https" </li>
<li>Subdomain: "mltv" </li>
<li>Subdomain: "s3" </li>
<li>Second-level domain: "amazonaws" </li>
<li>Top-level domain: "com"</li>
<li>Web page: "index.html"</li>

<p>To get to a web site from your location, a few things are needed. First, is your internet connection up and running? Here is a test to find out:
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Next, you need the IP address for the web site. Every domain name is assocated with an IP address. You can look up the IP address for this domain here:

<img src = "./images/lookup.PNG" width="1000" >
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>That IP address is configured on a physical server somewhere in the world. You may be interested to find out where this physical server is hosted:
</p>
<a href ="https://tools.keycdn.com/geo">Geo Location</a></br>
<img src = "./images/geo.PNG" width="600" >
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The physical server for this site is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The image below shows a 
management console for AWS. AWS is a cloud service that lets you spin up servers on demand. Did you know
that any student or educator can get free access to AWS for educational purposes? Check the link below!</p>

<p>Sometimes web sites go down. Is this one up and available? Check here:</p></br>

<p>Sometimes there are major outages on the Internet itself. Find out if that is a problem right now:</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Network traffic touches many routes on the way from the client to the server. Each time a network packet goes 
through a router, it's called a "hop". The data below shows the first few hops between my location and
the demo web site. After about a dozen hops, the network pathway is mostly hidden, probably because the carriers
along the way don't want us gathering information about their networks. </p>
