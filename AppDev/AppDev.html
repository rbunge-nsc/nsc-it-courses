Application Development Courses</h1>
<h2>North Seattle College IT</h2>
<h3>IT111 Programming Fundamentals
</h3>
<p>This will be our new first course in programming. The course will be taught with Python. This demonstration
website uses Python for a database web application. Below are some samples of the Python code 
used on this web site.</p>

<h3> IT112 Python Web Applications</h3>
<p>The code above is from a Python Web application. Web applications connect to databases on the backend and to web pages
on the front end. The code above is for the database connection. The code below illustates how database output
goes to a web site.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to host and develop a Python web application. For this project, the technologies
selected were those that were easiest to get up and running quickly. Some of these include:</p>

<ul style="font-family:verdana; font-size:15px; line-height:200%;">
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/">Gunicorn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>IT115 Introduction to Software Development and Version Control</h3>
<p> The early phases of a project like this website tend to be fairly disorganized. The main problem is to just 
get some of the code to work at all. For later phases of the project, to allow the project to grow larger and 
involve bigger teams, code needs to be cleaned up, organized, and managed. That's what IT115 will be teaching.</p>
<p>Below are a couple examples of some basic code managment and backup. The first image is from WinSCP. This was 
used to go into Amazon's cloud and get copies of all the files that make up this web site. The second image
is from GitHub. GitHub is a more sophisticated code management system that allows for multiple collaborators. 
If this project grows and involves more team members, GitHub will become important for managing the code. </p>
